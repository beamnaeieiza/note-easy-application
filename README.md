# A note-easy application (Back-end Developer)

This is a note-easy application build with TypeScript , using Hapi Framework and TypeORM to develop in PostgreSQL database.

## Front-end
Using React to create a front-end.

> [!NOTE]
> #### **The front-end is just for Simple Create,Read,Update and Delete in notes table with a specific CustomerId. Others API is not connected yet.**

Running using `npm start` (run the back-end first)

## Back-end
Created using Hapi framework, typeORM to develop postgreSQL database.

Running by using `npm run ts-node-dev index.ts` (Please update the database below if you want to connect)

## Database

In this application, I used postgreSQL and deploy as my localhost server. 

To connect the database, change the `data-source.ts` in Back-end

`host: '0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io`\
`port : 19434` 
> [!NOTE] 
> (the port might be change everytime I public the new localhost port. Sometimes I have to go study at university, so the port might be down. But I will keep updated it)


If you have problem connect to my localhost server, please do not hesitate to contact me.
